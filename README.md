# Remote-PT
The Virtual Way to Make Sure You Heal Healthy

Remote PT is physical therapy in the COVID-19 world. With people social-distancing and avoiding close contact, physical therapists are tasked with assigning PT workouts virtually. The issue is that many patients preform their workouts incorrectly, either meaning they do not improve at the normal rate or end up worsening their injury with worse form. Remote PT handles physical therapy routines with guided practice virtually. Rather than coming in person and measuring range of motion, Remote PT utilizes innovative Pose Estimation technology to locate the joints around the human body. Using this data, we are able to measure the range of motion in a series of workouts and analyze the performance of the patient. This data can be used by both the patient and the physical therapist to monitor their care. Remote PT can be extended to more workouts and better integration with Physical Therapists to create an ecosystem for care of patients.
